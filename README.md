## project outline:

I decided to work from one of the pre-defined project suggestions because  I wanted to put myself in a scenario where I create a website for a client that does not share my personal interest or design preferences. For me this meant a greater challange and what I can imagine is a more life like scenario in web development.



### end user goals  : 

>Typical users are interested in getting involved with online-classes and tutorship in yoga.

- __The typical end user wants to:__

  -  know more about site and yoga instructor
  - be able to subscribe to news coming from community regarding techniques and upcoming yoga sessions
  - get a hint about what is expected inside the paid members area
  - be able to sign up and become a full member, attending live- and pre recorded -yoga sessions
  - connect to community on social medias


- __a typical returning user wants to:__
  - sign in to their account and conduct yoga sessions.

### site owners goals:
>site owner wants to inspire potential end users who wants to learn yoga and market the benefits of yoga and let users connect with her community and sign up to engage in live and pre-recorded yoga sessions.

- __in short, the site owner wants to:__

  - educate new site visitors about herself
  - give breif overview of the benefits of yoga
  - let new users sign up to newsletter to keep them in the loop of what is happening in the community
  - let users know how they can engage in social media.
  - let existing users log in to view the paid-for content.

### Design And Content


My goal as a webdeveloper was to create a clutter free minimalistic website. Since the Website is Yoga / mindfullness oriented, I wanted the information provided to have lots of breathing room and the animation on elements to be somewhat slower than on a normal website to make it feel calm and relaxing. I also wanted the colors to be positive. For the color scheme I was inspired by different colors of yoga mats.


>I decided that the best way to adress the users and site owners needs was to device the website into two main parts.

1.  __an index page__ <br> 
        the main page, with a single page layout style where the site owner could present herself and the users could get to learn more about her and about yoga. 
2. __a members page__ <br>
        where existing users could sign in and a new user could choose to sing up and become a full member. I wanted this to be a separate page since it mostly contains of form elements and a separate page for this would reduce clutter on the website, making it look and feel cleaner
___
### __design features__
- >Elements that contain no text are __soft and rounded__.

- > Text areas are __square and light__ to stand out from the rest of the website and enhance readability. 

- >initially the colors are __few and muted__, as you progress down the site __more colors__ are mixed in to keep visitors curious and __enhance positivity__.

- > Elements have a __lot of space__ around them to feel more relaxed. 

- >Elements that have animations are __slow and subtle__ to make elements feel __relaxing__.

___
### __The index page consist of five sections:__ 

<details>
  <summary>
  <b>1.1 Header - an inspiering welcome</b> 
  <hr>
  </summary> 

![header section of FlexGridYoga](assets/img/readme/Screenshot-index-header.png)

>This is the first section of the website a user is presented to. I wanted it too look clean and relaxing.

 __Contains the following elements:__
 -  an inspiering __background image__ 
 -  __navigation menu__  that lets the user jump to the different sections

 - __a welcome heading__ -in this case the website's name -FlexGrid Yoga 
        instead of having a logo in the navigation bar
 -  __a textbox__ with a welcome text 
 
 - a __call-to-action button__ that takes the user to the join us page where 
       the user can choose to subscribe to a newsletter through a form or click a link to go to the sign-up form and become a full paying member.

>This section will let the users know who the site owner / instructor is through a breif presentation.

![Join section of FlexGridYoga](assets/img/readme/Screenshot-index-join.png)
