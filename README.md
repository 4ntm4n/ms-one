First milestone project at Code Institute showcasing a responsive website using vanilla HTML5 and CSS3

making a website for a personal yoga instructor. 
project outline:

end user goals:

users are interested in getting involved with online-classes and tutorship in yoga / mindfulness.

The typical end user wants to:

 know more about site host / instructor
 connect with host / instructors community
 be able to subscribe to news coming from community regarding techniques and upcoming yoga sessions
 be able to sign up and subscribe to live yoga and pre-recorded yoga sessions

a typical returning user wants to:
sign in to their account and conduct yoga sessions.

site owners goals:
site owner wants to inspire potential end users who wants to learn yoga and market the benefits of yoga and let users connect with her community and sign up to engage in live and pre-recorded yoga sessions.

in short, the site owner wants to:

educate new site visitors about herself
give breif overview of the benefits of yoga
let new users sign up to newsletter to keep them in the loop of what is happening in the community
let users know how they can engage in social media.

let existing users log in to view the paid-for content


approach: 
creating a clutter free minimalistic single page layout, a webpage that adresses the user- and site owners needs. 
the user interface should be easy to understand, positive and be inspiering in its use of layout and colors.

the website will be divided into a header a footer and three main sections inbetween, the information will be as follows:

header - inspiering welcome.

the header will contain a navigation menu, that lets the user jump to the different sections,
it will contain an inspiering image, a welcome text, and a call-to-action button that links to the sign-up page


section 1 - introduction to the tutor.

the first section will let the users know who the site owner / instructor is through a breif presentation. 
This has the highest informative priority since there are many different online yoga classes out there, and the first impression a user gets from the instructor herself is a key differentiator from the field competition.


section 2 - the benefits of yoga.

section two will contain of a number of different cards that explains the benefits of yoga.
the cards will be presented in an unordered list which layout will be styled differently on different screensizes to ensure a good UX across devices.


section 3 - newsletter and sign up
will contain of a form that encourage users to sign up to the newsletter where user will recieve notifications and news through email.
It will also contain another link to the sign-up page if visitors are ready to sign up to be a part of the community and get full access to the classes.


footer - links to social media

footer will contain a copyright claim and links to social media platforms. 


Signup 

Signup will be a separate page that let new users sign up to the paid-section of the site. It will consist of a form. 
Apart from the form there will also be a free yoga session video. the video is intended to let users know what to expect if they signup as well as inspire them to do so.
